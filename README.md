# Bike Frame Size Tool
## http://mattgreenfield.co.uk/bike-frame-size/

A tool for converting rider height and inside leg measurement to frame size for both road bikes and mountain bikes.
I created it because I couldn't find anything online that wasn't just an image of a table.
Please please please contact me if you think the sizes could be more accurate!

The code can be found on the 'gh-pages' branch as it's hosted on github pages.


### TODO
- [ ] Remove jquery and write in vanilla js
- [ ] Allow people to add their body measurements in inches.
- [ ] test against other tools and share with cyclists to check its accurate.
- [ ] Improve logic for hiding height when leg size is give, leg size is more accurate.
- [ ] Add advanced settings for more bike types; 29'er, triathlon, time-trial, hybrid.
